    <description>CLI11 provides all the features you expect in a powerful command line parser, with a beautiful, minimal syntax and no dependencies beyond C++11. It is header only, and comes in a single file form for easy inclusion in projects. It is easy to use for small projects, but powerful enough for complex command line projects, and can be customized for frameworks.
    
    Built with Azure Pipeline https://github.com/diogo-strube/build-nuget-cli11
    </description>
    <releaseNotes>New features include support for output of an empty vector, a summing option policy that can be applied more broadly, and an option to validate optional arguments to discriminate from positional arguments. A new validator to check for files on a default path is included to allow one or more default paths for configuration files or other file arguments. A number of bug fixes and code cleanup for various build configurations. Clean up of some error outputs and extension of existing capability to new types or situations.</releaseNotes>
